This image shows the peak duration being 5 minutes. Riding durations numbers dropping rapidly and the graph. The graph looks flat after the first hour.

## Summary

The data provieds enough evidence to show that bikeshare programs are extremely popular in highly populated urban areas where there are very few parking places.  The program's user base is primarily made up of male subscribers, who provide consistent revenue. Although more outreach is needed to recruit female riders, male bikers appear to be a solid market. And it appears that the majority of usage occurs between morning and evening commuting periods.

Two additional analysis and visualization:
- First would be to perform further analysis to compare weekend trip durations to weekday trip durations.
- Second would be get crime data and look at correlation between high crime rates and number of female bike users.
